# Cody Bennett

Hi there, I’m Cody. I am a designer, full-stack developer, and creator of web & mobile solutions with a focus on motion and user experience. My projects include UI/UX design, animation, illustration, and development. If you're interested in the tools and software I use check out my [uses page](https://codyb.co/uses).

In my spare time, I like to write music and experiment with new tech. I’m always interested in new projects, so feel free to [drop me a line](https://codyb.co/contact).
