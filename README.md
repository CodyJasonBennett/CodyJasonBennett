# Cody Bennett

Hi there, I'm Cody. I am a multidisciplinary designer & developer with a focus on motion and user experience. My projects include UI/UX design, animation, illustration, and development. If you are interested in the tools and software I use, check out my [uses page](https://codyb.co/uses).

In my spare time, I like to [play/compose music](https://youtube.codyb.co) and write [technical articles](https://codyb.co/articles). I am always interested in new projects, so feel free to [drop me a line](https://codyb.co/contact).
