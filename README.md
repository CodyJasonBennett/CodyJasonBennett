# Cody Bennett

Hi, I’m Cody. Currently, I am based in Austin, working as the lead designer at [DevTechTools](https://codyb.co/projects/dtt). I am a designer, full-stack developer, and creator of web & mobile solutions with a focus on motion and user experience.

In my spare time, I like to write music and [experiment with new tech](https://codepen.io/cbenn). I’m always interested in new projects, so feel free to [drop me a line](https://codyb.co/contact).
